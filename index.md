# 1. About the Alfa AWUS036ACM Adapter

- Dual-band support (2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi)
- USB 3.0 for high-speed data transfer
- Chipset: **MediaTek MT7612U**
- Supports monitor mode and packet injection

This makes it perfect for learning WiFi security and ethical hacking.

# 2. Installing the Driver on Kali Linux

âœ… Good news â€” as of the latest Kali Linux versions, the AWUS036ACM works **out of the box**!

But if you ever need to manually install drivers, you can:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms
```

(You might need this if you ever switch to older kernels or custom systems.)

# 3. Enabling Monitor Mode

To enable monitor mode on the Alfa adapter:

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan1 down
sudo iwconfig wlan1 mode monitor
sudo ip link set wlan1 up
```

Check if monitor mode is enabled:

```bash
iwconfig
```

You should now see `Mode:Monitor` for `wlan1`.

# 4. Basic Practical Tests

âœ… **Check available networks:**

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan1
```

âœ… **Test packet injection:**

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan1
```

âœ… **Capture WiFi handshakes (for learning only):**

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan1
```

(Target an open network you control, or your own router for legal testing!)

# 5. Final Thoughts

The **Alfa AWUS036ACM** is an excellent choice for cybersecurity students, hobbyists, and wireless researchers.

With its plug-and-play support on Kali Linux, strong performance, and reliable packet injection, it's a tool worth mastering!
